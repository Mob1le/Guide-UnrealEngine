### AActor

By inheriting from `AActor` class, you have these popular functions:

```cpp
/**
 * This function is called after the class's constructor, inside the Editor.
 * It's a safe way to initialize components inside the editor.
 */
void PostInitComponents();

/**
 * "Awake/Start" method
 *
 * This function is called when an actor is spawned or respawned.
 *
 * It's the perfect place to set up default values for your actor's
 * properties, initialize components, and start any asynchronous work
 * that needs to occur when the actor is first created.
 */
void BeginPlay();

/**
 * "Update" method
 *
 * This function is called every frame, with the time since the last
 * update as its parameter.
 *
 * Use this function to update your actor's state, like checking
 * whether it's colliding with something or not.
 *
 * NOTE; Try to avoid overusing Tick() function. Since, Unreal's core logic, is simply as runs for loop and calling each function for each lickable UObject. Which can be very expensive, with many and unnecessary update calls.
 * Here are some tips to overcome this issue:
 *      - Change your workflow to an event based driven system. Either by using delegates or single call functions.
 *      - Change your tick interval to a slower interval. If you require for UObject to tick, but don't require updating a single frame (then this is a perfect fit).
 *
 * @param DeltaTime Time since last update
 */
void Tick(float DeltaTime);

/**
 * "Destroy" method
 *
 * This function is called when an actor is destroyed, or when it's
 * forced to be destroyed (e.g. when its outermost `UWorld` is shut
 * down).
 *
 * It's a good place to clean up any resources that your actor
 * allocated during its lifetime. Like delegates (NOTE; some delegates are bind directly to UObject and don't require to unbind directly).
 */
void EndPlay();
